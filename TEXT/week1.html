            Gestures I explored were intuitive, and seemed fitting for their
            specific purposes. Some are shortcuts for executing a command, and
            others are meant to motivate and redirect common faults we
            experience (such as snoozing our alarm clock repeatedly)!

          <h3>HELLO WORLD</h3>
          <p>
            I experimented with basic HTML elements in conjunction with CSS
            formatting this week. My main goal was to understand semantic
            containers and using them to create hierarchy. As this is my first
            semester coding, I attempted easier elements such as creating lists,
            colouring divs and marking up a simple table. This has enabled me to
            create divs and style my page to fit content in specific parts of
            the background images to create a scene.
